2012-08-28  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Moved to GitHub.

2012-08-27  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added a work-around for all-day events on
	BlackBerry devices with the Funambol client,
	which is a real piece of crap.

2011-04-18  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Dropped common-configurations as a requirement
	and also dropped the handling of old plist handling
	for user preferences / settings. We now rely only
	on JSON data.

2011-04-17  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Fixed the TRANSP property handly for events
	* Fixed the update methods in the event and task
	classes to correctly pull the last-modification
	timestamp prior the merge.

2010-11-15  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoTaskUtilities.java
	Added a patch from joh@bo-tech.de to fix completion statut
	retrieval from various Funambol version

2010-11-11  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * We now convert relative alarms to absolute
	ones when downgrading vCalendar from v2 to v1

2010-07-27  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoUtilities.java
	Fixed the conversion of recurring events for SIF-E

2010-07-20  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Modified the getUpdatedSyncItemKeys to NOT include
	the start time (> instead of >=) - this avoids pulling
	back contacts that have been added/modified right after
	they were sent using a mobile device.
	* Added a PHOTO sync workaround for the iPhone before
	the data is being sent to the SOGo database.

2010-07-17  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoSanitizer.java
	Commented out the BlackBerry fields inversion code
	as it seems to be fixed in 8.5.x
	Also removed BlackBerry PHOTO stripping

2010-07-06  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoSyncSource.java
	Improved the slow sync code by really making sure a 
	name / firstname / lastname is defined prior to
	doing the comparison

2010-07-01  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* We now strip the PHOTO tag only for cards coming
	from the BlackBerry devices. This is due to a bug
	in the base64 encoder of that device.
	* Improved the vCard 3.0 -> 2.1 conversion, especially
	for notes containing \r\n in them.
	* Work around a field inversion bug from BB devices
	(using the Funambol BlackBerry client)

2010-06-04  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added some sanity checks when checking ACLs
	for "personal" folders
	* Improved the conversion of vCard v3 -> v2.1
	when dealing with non-ASCII characters. We
	keep using UTF-8 for the iPhone but for other
	devices, we encode everything in QP.

2010-05-24  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoUtilities.java
	SIFTovCalendar(): removed hack that was wiping the access
	class since that bug has been fixed in Funambol (at least, from v8.0)

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoUtilities.java
	vCardV3toV21(): improved the conversion by checking if the
	device that syncs is an iPhone. If so, we toy around with
	some fields.

2010-05-21  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org> that
	fixes calendar sync tags getting duplicated

2010-05-13  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoSanitizer.java
	We now strip any PHOTO tag we see
	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoUtilities.java
	Modified the vCard 3 -> 2.1 converter in order to keep
	as much as possible various "types" (of emails, telephones
	numbers, etc.) across synchronizations and devices.
	* Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	that cleanups various stuff such as:
	  1. serialVersionUid should be private
	  2. Content type versions are wrong (at least if they refer to vCalendar and iCalendar)
	  3. There should probably be no else after SIF check 
	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoUtilities.java
	Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org> that
	tries to keep the alarm definition during v2 -> v1 conversion
	of iCalendar data.

2010-04-14  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	that fixes lines folding issues.

2010-04-09  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	that cleans the vCalendar <-> iCalendar mess.

2010-04-05  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoSanitizer.java
	We avoid stripping "empty" properties followed by folded
	lines (usually base64-encoded cruft).

2010-03-18  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	to consider correctly task status and priority.
	
	* Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	to turn off auto-commit if enabled from the db driver.

	* Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	to correctly log all exception's stacktrace to
	the ds-server.log file.

	* Added sanitizevCardOutput() to cleanup the mess
	clients send us before injecting the data in the
	SOGo database. We now also strip in this new
	method (and its sanitizevCardInput() counterpart)
	the empty attributes which create a lot of
	confusion for SOGo/Thunderbird and clients in general.


2010-03-08  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added a patch from Håvard Wigtil <havardw@pvv.org>
	which tries to use the event/task's creation/modification
	date (or the item's one) for event/task/contact instead
	of just the current local time. This avoid getting
	back from the server newly created objects from
	the mobile device.

2010-02-19  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* We now honor the access class that can be
	specified in events / tasks.
	* Added a patch from Albrecht Gebhardt <albrecht.gebhardt@algepop.net>
	to support combined event / task sync sources.
	* Fixed timezone issues
	* Released v1.0.7

2010-02-16  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

        * Added patch from Albrecht Gebhardt <albrecht.gebhardt@algepop.net>
	which fixes various issues with alarms and b64 encoding.
	* Cleaned up some warnings.

2010-01-06  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoContactUtilities.java
	Make sure we use the givenName + sn if displayName is null

	* src/java/ca/inverse/sogo/engine/source/SOGoSyncSource.java
	When removing items, make sure we update the c_lastmodified
	column so WebDAV sync works properly. 

2009-12-10  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

        * Replaced the JSON parser since the original
	version was quite stupid
	* Added merge capabilities for events and tasks.
	The code is there for contacts but needs some
	more love.

2009-11-30  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Added JSON supports for defaults / settings
	coming out from the database.
	* We now correctly strip the tag name when inserting
	the calendar content in the datatabase
	* We now allow the synchronization of personal calendars
	from other users.
	* Reworked getPreferredEmail() to not return empty content

2009-09-21  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* We now always return the items encoded in
	base64 to avoid SIF exceptions.


2009-08-18	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Added tag-based support for synchronizing
	multiple calendars.
	* Got rid of old code that was no longer used
	as we moved to Funambol v7.1.


2009-06-09	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Added compatibility for Funambol 7.x
	* Added support for MySQL
	* Fixed small bugs there and there	


2008-07-23	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Added missing SOGoUser.java file


2008-07-07	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* We now require a TCP port to be specified in SOGoOfficer.xml
	  Normally, this should be the host/port of a 'sogod' instance.
	* Vastly improved the SOGo sanitizer. It was incorrectly adding UID
	  fields and the line folding code wasn't 100% accurate.
	* We now also always unfold the ATTENDEE lines before Funambol
	  reads them to avoid parsing exceptions in Funambol.
	* Fixed bugs in the RRULE parser


2008-05-21	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Cleanups for various warnings
	* Release of v1.0.4


2008-05-20	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Fixed a small bug in N: addition in case parameters were
	  added to the initial attribute.
	* Reimplemented getSyncItemKeysFromTwin()
	* Refactored / simplified some code
	

2008-04-01	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Added a hack in the SIF-{E,T} -> vCalendar
	  converter to avoid exceptions in Funambol v6.5 with
	  events containing an access class attribute.
	* Updated the code to reflect database schema changes
	  in SOGo.
	* Modified SOGoUtilities: -getUserTimeZone() to avoid
	  throwing an exception in case no user-timezone is set.
	  We also log a warning if that's the case.
	* We now close all resultsets to avoid cursor leakage
	  in Oracle.
	* Implemented getSyncItemKeysFromTwin() 
	* Modified updateSyncItem() so that we skip updates
	  during a slow sync to avoid "losing" data on the
	  server as we don't do any merge right now.
	* Improved / fixed the SIF -> vCalendar code and
	  we no longer assume that the first item is an
	  event / todo when converting a vCalendar to
	  a SIF event / task.
	  
	
2008-02-08  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Updated the PIM framework to v6.5.6
	* Modified vCardV3toV21() so that we check
	  if the 'N' property was defined. If not, we
	  set it to 'Unknown'.
	* Imported the S4jPropertyConverter class from Funambol
	  into our connector (as SOGoPropertyConverter) as we
	  make use of it an it's supposedly deprecated but
	  no-one @ Funambol could give us an intelligent response.
	* We now strip the DTSTAMP attribute and we convert the TRANSP
	  attribute to the vCalendar v1 format in our sanitizer.
	* Funambol accounts are now automatically created for users
	  able to authenticate to a SOGo server. This is now done
	  with the new SOGo Officer. See the README for all details.
	* Added an output "sanitizer" for vCalendar information in order
	  to avoid client-side bugs (such as "AALARM:;;;" on SyncJe
	  v2.37 and earlier).


2007-11-23 	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Fixed addvTodoSyncItem() to set c_isopaque to
	  a non-NULL value.
	* We now also sanitize task's input before
	  an insert / update.
	* We now also call sanitizevCalendarInput() before
	  converting items from v2 to v1.
	* We now check if the device supports UTC before
	  inserting/updating tasks and if now, we adjust
	  the start/due dates based on the user's time zone.
	* Fixed an issue for taks in vCalendarv2Tov1 and
	  improved its robustness.


2007-11-09 	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Implemented support for recurring events and
	  conversion of RRULE:s from/to v1/v2
	* We no longer encode/decode our keys as URLs
	  since Lightning breaks on them. Keys starting
	  with ./ were re-encoded with .%2F but Lightning
	  would duplicate events upon modification. For example,
	  ".%2Ffoobar" would be re-encoded as "foobar".
	* Optimized SOGoSyncSource: updateSyncItem().
	* Improved the sanitizers to avoid tons of bugs in
	  connecting clients.
	* Improved the cleanness of our v2.0 -> v1.0
	  calendar converter.


2007-11-01	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>	

	* Fixed encoding issues with contacts and events during
	  conversion to older standards
	* Fixed the c_version changes after an update on contacts,
	  events or tasks.
	* Fixed tz issues wrt all-day events and start/end dates
	  in the _quick tables.
	* Modified SOGoSyncSource: init() so that we correctly
	  adjust the supported Content-Type:s since some clients,
	  like Synthesis SyncML do require that.
	* Introduced methods to fix input content to avoid ugly
	  crashes in Funambol. See:
	  http://forge.objectweb.org/tracker/?group_id=96&atid=100096&func=detail&aid=307471
	* Introduce methods to fix output content to avoid
	  compatibilities with various SyncML clients.
	* We now require
	   - Funambol v6.5 or later
	   - Funambol Outlook Plug-in v6.5.1 or later


2007-09-04	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>
	
	* Complete SIF support was added
	* Fixed the JDK requirements in build.xml
	* We now consider the user's time zone when manipulating
	  date information. Apache commons collections, configuration
	  and lang are now REQUIRED. You can place the jar files in
	  Funambol/tools/tomcat/common/lib/.
    * Oracle database support
    * Fixed the time zone issues with events coming from
      Mozilla Sunbird or Mozilla Lightning (TZID in DTSTART/DTEND)
	

2007-08-24	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@inverse.ca>

	* Initial release (v1.0.0). Supports every aspects
	  of synchronization. Needs better time zone and
	  vCard 2.0 / vCalendar 1.0 support. Also needs
	  improved SIF support.
